Kansas Lava

Kansas Lava is a Haskell library which allows the specification and
simulation of hardware, and hardware level concerns.  Haskell
functions written in Kansas Lava can be interpreted as having the
semantics of a specific circuit, or compiled into VHDL, for
compilation and synthesis using standard HDL tools.

To run tests

% cd tests
% make test		-- use 'make ARGS=--gensim' if you want to generate VHDL
% make simulate		-- [optional] if you want to test the VHDL using modelsim
% make report		-- generate test report
