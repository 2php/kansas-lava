If you want to run the tests in GHCi, use 

% ghci XXX.hs -i../..

To run tests

% make tests

The test script places the output in ./run, and compares it with files of the same name in ./ref.

If you want to remaster a test, copy the output from the ./run directory, into the ./ref directory,
and the add-and-commit the ./ref copy.
